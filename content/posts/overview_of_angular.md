Google designed Angular as a ground-up rewrite of AngularJS.

Angular does not have a concept of "scope" or controllers; instead, it uses a hierarchy of components as its primary architectural characteristic.
Angular has a different expression syntax, focusing on "[ ]" for property binding, and "( )" for event binding
Modularity â€“ much core functionality has moved to modules
Angular recommends the use of Microsoft's TypeScript language, which introduces the following features:
Static typing, including Generics
Annotations
TypeScript is a superset of ECMAScript 6 (ES6), and is backwards compatible with ECMAScript 5 (i.e.: JavaScript).
Dynamic loading
Asynchronous template compilations
Iterative callbacks provided by RxJS. RxJS limits state visibility and debugging, but these can be solved with reactive add-ons like NgRx or NGXS.[according to whom?]
Support for Angular Universal, which runs Angular applications on servers.
