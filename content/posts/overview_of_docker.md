description: "Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers."

Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. Because all of the containers share the services of a single operating system kernel, they use fewer resources than virtual machines.

The service has both free and premium tiers. The software that hosts the containers is called Docker Engine.[8] It was first started in 2013 and is developed by Docker, Inc.
